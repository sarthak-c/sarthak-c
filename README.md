- Hi, I am Sarthak Chatterjee! I currently work as an Associate Scientist - Postdoctoral Fellow at Merck, where I am working on analyzing data from digital health technologies and wearables to develop digital biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's Disease.
- I obtained my Ph.D. from the department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where my broad focus area was control theory and optimization.
- During my Ph.D., I was working on using tools from optimization and control to develop methods for system identification, robust and resilient state estimation, and closed-loop control of fractional-order systems, exploring the applications of the aforementioned in developing novel neurotechnologies to attenuate the effects of neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy.
- I'm always looking to chat (and learn new things) about healthcare analytics, digital data and digital health technologies, and the use of machine learning in the clinical trials / drug development sector. Please drop me a message!
